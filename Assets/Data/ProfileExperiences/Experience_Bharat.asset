  - '//CasteNoBar features characters played by kind friends. These profiles are
    works of fiction. What you will see are essentially a bunch of stories, all woven
    together from real experiences. '
  - Now, you've chosen Bharat's profile. <br><br>Click on the bottom right arrow
    to experience her narrative.
  - "A closer look at his description of himself through \u201CBasics\u201D and \u201CInterests\u201D.
    And how these alter who swipes right on him."
  - "Bharat swipes right on most women\u2019s profiles to see which ones match with
    him eventually. We are told that the ratio of men to women on these apps is such.
    Click on bottom arrow to continue."
  - We savarnas like to have everyone believe that a lot is up to chance. Quietly
    denying that chance is actually a well planned schema.
  - "Tap on the bottom right arrow to see how chance operates in Bharat\u2019s and
    Chetana\u2019s lives."
  - In the absence of policies that address caste structure and its material effects,
    and skewed hiring practices, product based companies, just like the top jobs
    in judiciary or education, inevitably favour savarnas.
  - TBD
  - "And the \u201Cnetworks\u201D grow, even through the channel of dating\u2026
    benefiting us in all other spheres. "
