  - '//CasteNoBar features characters played by kind friends. These profiles are
    works of fiction. What you will see are essentially a bunch of stories, all woven
    together from real experiences. '
  - Now, you've chosen Anusha's profile. <br><br>Click on the bottom right arrow
    to experience her narrative.
  - Tap on the bottom right arrow to look more closely at the interests Anusha presents
    on the dating app
  - "For a glimpse of Anusha\u2019s experience as she looks through different profiles,<br>click
    on the bottom right arrow to continue."
  - "Tap on Neil's photo in the next screen to see how it could have been different\u2026
    and if Anusha would swipe right then. "
  - "But what stories do we, savarnas, find interesting? The kind that fits into
    our aesthetic, something we aspire for. Not something we\u2019ve already experienced
    many years ago thanks to our quick upward mobility."
  - "It\u2019s no surprise that Neil and Anusha found each other on the app, the
    algorithm did its job. Now they do theirs..."
  - "Invested in social issues far away from our realities, turning to white icons
    who offer alternative discourses\u2026 having already consumed content that problematizes
    something we enjoyed as children\u2026 all traits of progressive individuals. "
  - We even deliberately bring up social issues we support, to see if the match has
    similar values. But how is that ever going to be enough to understand our location
    in relation to our society?
  - "Anusha and Neil keep talking though, since they relate with each other on so
    many things\u2026 Black Lives Matter and Feminism, the importance of public transport,
    how social science research needs funding..."
  - Would you mind?
