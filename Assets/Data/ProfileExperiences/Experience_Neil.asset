  - '//CasteNoBar features characters played by kind friends. These profiles are
    works of fiction. What you will see are essentially a bunch of stories, all woven
    together from real experiences. '
  - Now, you've chosen Neil's profile. <br><br>Click on the bottom right arrow to
    experience her narrative.
  - A closer look at how Neil chooses to present himself to women on the app. Tap
    on the prompt on the next screen to see what it really tries to communicate.
  - "Linking other apps to our profile is a great plus cause what can define us better
    than our Spotify and IG, right? A closer look at Neil\u2019s\u2026"
  - "There\u2019s no simple way of saying how we retain sway over what is considered
    to be good taste\u2026 sometimes it\u2019s obscure artists that do the job, sometimes
    it\u2019s not."
  - "Neil swipes right on most women\u2019s profiles to see which ones match with
    him eventually. We hear that the ratio of men to women on these apps is such
    that this becomes necessary."
  - "Now a glimpse of Neil navigating the app\u2026"
  - On matching with Deepti, a regular conversation begins..
  - "Sometimes there\u2019s a disconnect when we talk to a match\u2026"
  - "Sure, hundreds of us connect on food\u2026 but discomfort with food easily stands
    in for notions of purity and impurity. Just a matter of choice, it\u2019s an
    individualistic twist on systematic oppression."
  - "Safe to say Neil and Deepti didn\u2019t unmatch"
